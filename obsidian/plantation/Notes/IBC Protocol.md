An open-source protocol designed to facilitate message relaying between separate distributed ledgers and was developed to connect independent blockchains.

- Facilitates data sharing and communication between different blockchains or **zones**.
- Created and introduced in 2019 to address the issue of isolated blockchains, enabling them to safely exchange assets and data, promoting a more accessible and scalable blockchain ecosystem.
- The interchain foundation (ICF) established interchain standards (ICS) to specify the necessary functions for the IBC protocol within the Cosmos ecosystem.
- IBC is trustless and permisionless, meaning anyone can act as relayer.
