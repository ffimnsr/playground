To connect a Vita to PC, open VitaShell then press `Start` and change USB type to `Mass Storage`, then target `sd2vita`. Once configuration is done press `Select` to access the mass storage on any OS.
#### PSV games
The PSV games can be downloaded from the nopaystation site. This would give URL's for PKG and `Work.bin` file. You can also view the PKG URL's on the TSV file. 

To create a digestible package for Vita, you need pkg2zip to convert pkg to zip archive. The zip archive contains structure that can be put on `ux0:` directory.
