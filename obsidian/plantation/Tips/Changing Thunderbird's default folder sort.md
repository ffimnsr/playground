The default sort order for each folder is `ascending`. In order to change it, we need to access the config editor. To access the config editor go to `Settings -> General` then scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Config Editor**.

Search for the key `mailnews.default_sort_order` and change the value from **1** (ascending) to **2** (descending).
