## STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
The STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) method, a.k.a. the STAR format, is a way to answer behavioral interview questions and other common questions that require storytelling. It proves you’ve got the skills needed to excel in the position you applied for — based on a story about how you used those skills in the past.

Usually, you’ll need to use the STAR technique when answering behavioral interview questions, that is, questions that begin with:

- Tell me about a time when…
- Can you recall a situation in which…
- Give me an example of a time when you…

The STAR method can be useful in answering any question, whenever you’d like to use a story or illustrate something with an example. For instance, questions about:

- Your proudest accomplishments
- Times you failed
- Your strengths
- Your weaknesses
- Situational questions – questions about a hypothetical situation
### Situation
Describe the situation so that your interviewer understands the context. There’s no need to be too detailed. Providing a general context with the most important facts should be enough. This should take around 15% of the total answer time.

```text
Last holiday season, our store had unprecedented foot traffic. There were long queues and both our customers and employees were getting frustrated.
```
### Task
Briefly describe your specific task or responsibility in that situation. No need to go into detail here either, just make sure to highlight what your role was.

This is usually the shortest part and should account for 10% of the whole answer.

```text
I recognized the issue and decided to do something to improve our efficiency and increase customer satisfaction.
```
### Action
The main part of your STAR answer. You need to be as detailed as possible when describing what actions you took to achieve something. The Action part should take up around 60% of your answer.

```text
First, I examined our checkout flow to spot the bottlenecks. I saw that the delays occurred mainly because of the lack of a dedicated gift-wrapping station. So I researched the necessary materials, estimated the budget, and pitched the idea to the store manager. I detailed the plan and explained the benefits: a faster checkout process, increased customer satisfaction and general positive experience, and additional revenue for gift-wrapping services. I also highlighted the potential for additional sales through impulse purchases. The manager was supportive of the idea, so we organized training for several employees from different departments to ensure they could seamlessly switch between their business-as-usual duties and gift-wrapping.
```
### Result
Here, you should mention the tangible results of your actions. Ideally, these will be quantifiable data (%, $), but you can also include qualitative things (bonuses, positive feedback, promotions, awards).

```text
We saw significant results — the gift-wrapping station reduced checkout times by 24% and the streamlined process made our team more efficient. Because of this, we introduced a gift-wrapping station for each major holiday, and other stores in the city did the same. The experience taught me the importance of taking initiative and problem-solving, and how these two affect not only me but the entire team positively.

Interviewer:

```text
Share an example of when you had to adapt to a team member’s working style.
```

Candidate:

```text
**Situation:** A few months ago, I was assigned to work on a project with a coworker from another department.

**Task:** Our task was to develop processes for several new services our agency introduced to our clients. After the initial meeting, I noticed big differences in how he and I approach work. I’m flexible and tend to focus on the big picture. He’s detail-oriented and prefers a structured approach.

**Action:** We decided to split the work accordingly. I focused on the goals of these new services and how to best follow them through procedures. I also worked on identifying key milestones and major project components. He, in turn, worked on granular steps, created structured plans for each project phase, and developed in-depth documentation and manuals explaining the processes.

**Result:** We ended up completing the project a week before the deadline and with minimal reiterations from the management team. The experience taught me that such a big difference in working styles is not a disadvantage: on the contrary, it’s a complementary strength that helps us contribute to the team and the company in the best possible way.
