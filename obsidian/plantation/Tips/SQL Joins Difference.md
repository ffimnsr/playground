Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

- `(INNER) JOIN`: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
- `LEFT (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
- `RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
- `FULL (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
